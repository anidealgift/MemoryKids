                    For a better experience, while using our Service,
                    I may require you to provide us with certain

                    I want to inform you that whenever
                    you use my Service, in a case of an error in the
                    game I collect data and information (through third
                    party products) on your phone called Log Data. This Log Data
                    may include information such as your device Internet
                    Protocol (“IP”) address, device name, operating system
                    version, the configuration of the game when utilizing
                    my Service, the time and date of your use of the
                    Service, and other statistics.
                  </p> <p><strong>Cookies</strong></p> <p>
                    Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are
                    commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers. These are
                    sent to your browser from the websites that you visit and
                    are stored on your device's internal memory.
                  </p> <p>
                    This Service does not use these “cookies” explicitly.
                    However, the game may use third party code and libraries that
                    use “cookies” to collect information and improve their
                    services. You have the option to either accept or refuse

                  </p> <p><strong>Service Providers</strong></p> <p>
                    I may employ third-party companies
                    and individuals due to the following reasons:
                  </p> <ul><li>To facilitate our Service;</li> <li>To provide the Service on our behalf;</li> <li>To perform Service-related services; or</li> <li>To assist us in analyzing how our Service is used.</li></ul> <p>
                    I want to inform users of this
                    Service that these third parties have access to your
                    Personal Information. The reason is to perform the tasks
                    assigned to them on our behalf. However, they are obligated
                    not to disclose or use the information for any other
                    purpose.
                  </p> <p><strong>Security</strong></p> <p>
                    I value your trust in providing us
                    your Personal Information, thus we are striving to use
                    commercially acceptable means of protecting it. But remember
                    that no method of transmission over the internet, or method
                    of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and
                    I cannot guarantee its absolute security.
                  </p> <p><strong>Links to Other Sites</strong></p> <p>
                    This Service may contain links to other sites. If you click
                    on a third-party link, you will be directed to that site.
                    Note that these external sites are not operated by
                    me. Therefore, I strongly advise you to

                    responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or
                    practices of any third-party sites or services.

                    These Services do not address anyone under the age of 13.
                    I do not knowingly collect personally
                    identifiable information from children under 13. In the case
                    I discover that a child under 13 has provided
                    me with personal information,
                    I immediately delete this from our servers. If you
                    are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child
                    has provided us with personal information, please contact
                    me so that I will be able to do

										<h2>Terms and Conditions</h2>
										<p>
                    By downloading or using the game, these terms will
                    automatically apply to you – you should make sure therefore
                    that you read them carefully before using the game. You’re
                    not allowed to copy, or modify the game, any part of the game,
                    or our trademarks in any way. You’re not allowed to attempt
                    to extract the source code of the game, and you also
                    shouldn’t try to translate the game into other languages, or
                    make derivative versions. The game itself, and all the trade
                    marks, copyright, database rights and other intellectual
                    property rights related to it, still belong to
                    Cinnamon Works .
                  </p> <p>
                    The Memory Kids game stores and processes personal data
                    that you have provided to us, in order to provide
                    my Service. It’s your responsibility to keep your
                    phone and access to the game secure. We therefore recommend
                    that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the
                    process of removing software restrictions and limitations
                    imposed by the official operating system of your device. It
                    could make your phone vulnerable to
                    malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone’s
                    security features and it could mean that the
                    Memory Kids game won’t work properly or at all.
                  </p> <p>
                    You should be aware that there are certain things that
                    Cinnamon Works  will not take responsibility for.
                    Certain functions of the game will require the game to have an
                    active internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi, or
                    provided by your mobile network provider, but
                    Cinnamon Works  cannot take responsibility for the
                    game not working at full functionality if you don’t have
                    access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any of your data
                    allowance left.
                  </p> <p></p> <p>
                    If you’re using the game outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you
                    should remember that your terms of the agreement with your
                    mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you
                    may be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data
                    for the duration of the connection while accessing the game,
                    or other third party charges. In using the game, you’re
                    accepting responsibility for any such charges, including
                    roaming data charges if you use the game outside of your home
                    territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data
                    roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on
                    which you’re using the game, please be aware that we assume
                    that you have received permission from the bill payer for
                    using the game.
                  </p> <p>
                    Along the same lines, Cinnamon Works  cannot always
                    take responsibility for the way you use the game i.e. You
                    need to make sure that your device stays charged – if it
                    runs out of battery and you can’t turn it on to avail the
                    Service, Cinnamon Works  cannot accept
                    responsibility.
                  </p> <p>
                    With respect to Cinnamon Works ’s responsibility for
                    your use of the game, when you’re using the game, it’s
                    important to bear in mind that although we endeavour to
                    ensure that it is updated and correct at all times, we do
                    rely on third parties to provide information to us so that
                    we can make it available to you.
                    Cinnamon Works  accepts no liability for any loss,
                    direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying
                    wholly on this functionality of the game.
                  </p> <p>
                    At some point, we may wish to update the game. The game is
                    currently available on Android &amp; iOS – the requirements for
                    both systems (and for any additional systems we
                    decide to extend the availability of the game to) may change,
                    and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep
                    playing the game. Cinnamon Works  does not promise that
                    it will always update the game so that it is relevant to you
                    and/or works with the Android &amp; iOS version that you have
                    installed on your device. However, you promise to always
                    accept updates to the game when offered to you, We
                    may also wish to stop providing the game, and may terminate
                    use of it at any time without giving notice of termination
                    to you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination,
                    (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms
                    will end; (b) you must stop using the game, and (if needed)
                    delete it from your device.
                  </p> <p><strong>Changes to This Terms and Conditions</strong></p> <p>
                    I may update our Terms and Conditions
                    from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page
                    periodically for any changes. I will
                    notify you of any changes by posting the new Terms and
                    Conditions on this page. These changes are effective
                    immediately after they are posted on this page.
